The process begins in the **Offer & Production Management** spreadsheet, in the **OFFERS** sheet. From the **Create** menu, the user selects a bike category—such as _Gravel Bike_, _City Bike_, or _Single Speed_—and then chooses a drivetrain variant. In this example, we’ll configure a gravel bike with a _Shimano GRX 2x11_ drivetrain.

This launches a modal dialog inside Google Sheets containing an HTML form. The layout and interactive components are styled with **Bootstrap** CSS to give the interface a clean, modern look and a more user-friendly experience.
