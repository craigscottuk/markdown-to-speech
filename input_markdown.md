Now let’s switch over to the **Sales Analytics** sheet, which focuses on how offers are being created, accepted, and converted over time.

The first pair of charts in blue shows a month-by-month comparison for 2024, with accepted offers in blue and total offers in light blue. Directly below, we have the same view for 2025, this time in red. On the right, the stacked bar charts present the same data as proportions, making it easier to see the conversion rate at a glance.

The next set of charts compares 2024 and 2025 directly — blue for 2024 and red for 2025. With the first pair, we’re comparing the total number of offers created in each year which let's us see how much interest we had for our bikes compared to last year. Below that, the number of offers accepted, converted sales basically allowing us too compare to the previous year. The same data is also shown in a line chart on the right, making it easy to spot differences in activity between the two years.

Further down, we move into sales team performance. The **2024 Sales Offer Creation Overview** shows monthly volumes for each team member — Marek in blue, Sandra in red, and Anna in yellow — with the stacked bar chart alongside showing the same data with monthly totals. The next section repeats this format for 2025.

At the bottom are the annual performance summaries for each team member, comparing 2024 with 2025. Each column shows offers created versus offers accepted, and the proportional charts alongside make it easy to compare creation and acceptance rates side by side.
