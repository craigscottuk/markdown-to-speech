Let’s try that now. We’ll change the bike’s paint colour from **Black** to **Red**, and switch the document language from **English** to **Polish**. Then we’ll generate a new document and draft email. After clicking **Yes** to open the **Drafts** folder, we’ll see a new draft email has appeared.

If we open it, we can see the subject line and message are both in Polish. Clicking on the attached document, we’ll see that it’s also written in Polish — and the image has been updated to show the bike in **red** instead of **black**.

Back in the main spreadsheet, the **Design** column now reflects the updated paint colour. And if we open the offer document for this customer, we’ll see that the latest version is correctly linked — it’s in **Polish**, and the bike colour is now **Red**.

All PDFs generated by the system — whether from the main **Offer & Production** spreadsheet or the **Project Manager** — are saved in a shared **Google Drive** folder, accessible only to the team.

In the next video, we’ll take a look at how to mark an offer as paid — and move it into the production stages of the system.
