Finally, over on the far right of the sheet, there is a set of cost-related columns helps validate the **System Price** and flag any issues before the offer moves into production:

- The **Painting Costs** column – Shows the cost of the selected paint job
- Next to that, the **Estimated Configuration Cost** displays the total net cost of all recognised components, using live pricing from the **Inventory & Parts Management** sheet
- and lastly, the **Unknown Items** column – Flags any components not recognised by the system. Like the Configuration column, these appear in a dropdown for quick review, helping the team catch errors and ensure the build is complete and accurate
