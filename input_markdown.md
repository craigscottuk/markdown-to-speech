There are two key pricing columns in the **OFFERS** sheet: **System Price** in Column F and **Offer Price** in Column G.

When a new offer is submitted, formulas are automatically applied to that row. These formulas calculate the **System Price**, which then generates the **Offer Price**.

Both values are influenced by the **Currency** in Column D and the **VAT Rate** in Column E.

This system was developed for a Polish bike manufacturer, so the prices in this demo are shown in **Polish złoty (PLN)** and **Euros (EUR)** — with **Polish złoty** being the system’s primary operating currency.
