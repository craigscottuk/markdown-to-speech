Every row within a sub-section represents a specific part used in that area of the bike. Let’s take a closer look at the **Cranksets** sub-section.

For each item listed, we track key details across the following columns:

- **Item Name** – the full product name used to describe the component
- **Item Code** – the official product code assigned by the manufacturer
- **Manufacturer** – who makes the item
- **Item Category** – the type of part it is (for example, crankset, bottom bracket, chainring — in this case, all are cranksets)
- **Bike Type** – the kind of build it’s typically used for (such as gravel or city bikes)
- **Price (PLN, NET)** – the net price in Polish złoty. This value is central to calculating costs, generating offers, and flagging missing parts.

You’ll see multiple versions of each part listed — often differing in crank arm length, model, or tooth count.

This sheet acts as the single source of truth for part pricing. Whenever a component is selected in a project, the system automatically references this index to pull in the correct net price — ensuring consistency across quoting, procurement, and real-time inventory tracking.
