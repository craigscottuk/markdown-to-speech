Back in the **Offer & Production Management** spreadsheet, we’ll click **OK** to dismiss the prompt — and we can see that the transfer is complete: **Donaldson** has now been removed from this stage.

Looking at the remaining projects in the **Parts Preparation** section, we’ll see that nothing is currently available for other builds — since the parts have been booked for **Donaldson**. At this point, we’re not able to move any other projects forward, as they’re all showing **0 parts available** and **0% readiness** — with red conditional formatting applied once again.

To move these projects to the next stage, we’ll need to purchase and add more components to the system.

And finally, if we switch over to the **ASSEMBLY & TESTING** sheet, we can now see **Donaldson** listed there — ready for the next phase of production, which we’ll cover in the next video.
