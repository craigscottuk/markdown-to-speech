So just to summarise, the **System Price** includes:

- the target net margin
- labour for customer communication, preparation, and assembly
- the design and painting cost
- the estimated configuration cost
- and finally, VAT

If the customer’s preferred currency is PLN, the gross value appears in złoty. If EUR was chosen, the final price is converted to Euros.

Lastly, let’s look at the **Offer Price** in Column G. This is the final amount shown to the customer in the PDF offer document that the system generates and sends. It’s based on the **System Price**, but rounded using predefined rules to create clean, retail-friendly figures.

For example:  
PLN prices are rounded up to end in **99 zł**, while EUR prices round up to end in **...9 €** — all applied automatically.

If any changes are made to the offer, the **System Price** updates — and the **Offer Price** recalculates with a newly rounded value.

That said, the **Offer Price** can still be manually overridden by the sales team if a custom figure needs to be applied.

In the next video, we’ll look at how to generate a PDF offer document.
