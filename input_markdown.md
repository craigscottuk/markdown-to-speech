The Delivery Method dropdown is used to select either **DELIVERY** or **PICK-UP**, depending on what the customer has chosen. If **DELIVERY** is selected, the customer’s address is automatically displayed in the **Details** column.If the address needs updating, we can open the project in the **Project Manager**, navigate to the **CUSTOMER** tab, and make the change — for example, updating the postcode. Back in the main spreadsheet, we can see the address has been updated automatically.
