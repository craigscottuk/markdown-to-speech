To log a new item, we start by selecting the Item Code from the dropdown in column C. We can scroll through the full list or begin typing to filter results. Once selected, the rest of the product details — including Name, Manufacturer, and Item Category — are automatically filled in from the PARTS INDEX. The Date in column B is also populated with today’s date by default, but it can be manually adjusted to match the actual delivery or invoice date.
