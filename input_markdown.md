This sheet is dynamically generated from the **STOCK LEVELS** sheet and highlights items that are currently below the required levels for production.

Its purpose is to give the team a clear view of what's needed to complete all active builds — along with the estimated cost to source the missing parts.

At the top right, we can see the **Estimated Net Cost of Missing Items**, which in this case totals **78,406 zł**.

Now let’s move to the final sheet — **SURPLUS STOCK**.

This sheet highlights parts that are sitting in surplus — components that aren’t currently needed for production.

It helps the team identify items that might be worth selling, repurposing, or promoting — to improve cash flow or free up space in storage.

At the top right, we can also see the **Estimated Net Value of Surplus Items**, which in this case totals **90,278 zł**.
