Itâ€™s important that part names match exactly, since entries here are validated against data from the **PARTS INDEX**, located in the **Inventory & Parts Management** spreadsheet.

If a part is mistyped or not recognised by the system, a Google Sheets data validation rule will flag the cell and display a warning.
