The formula here calculates the cost of each component listed in the configuration. You’ll notice the relevant data spans columns **AC to BX**. These columns pull in pricing from the **Inventory & Parts Management** spreadsheet — specifically the **PARTS INDEX** sheet — where each item has a net price managed by the team. The formula totals the cost of all selected components and displays the combined net value here.

Another key factor in the **System Price** is the **design and painting cost**, shown under the blue headers. This reflects the cost of painting the frame and fork based on the customer’s chosen colour scheme. For this demo, we’re using simplified options and pricing.

Next, under the black headers, are the **labour estimates** — covering tasks like frame preparation, assembly, and customer communication. These values can be manually adjusted by the salesperson to account for more complex or time-consuming projects.
