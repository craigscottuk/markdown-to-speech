The **Status** column contains dropdowns that allow the sales team to update each offer’s stage in the sales process. **REMOVE** is selected for offers that have been unsuccessful — for example, if the customer declines the quote or chooses not to proceed. This runs a script that sends a copy of the original offer to the **OFFERS ARCHIVE**, where the data is used to track interest and conversion over time.
