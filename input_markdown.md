Each offer is created using a set of guided forms that walk the sales team through the configuration process â€” we covered how these forms work in the video titled **ðŸŽ¥ Part 1 â€“ Creating a New Bike Offer with Guided Configuration Forms**.

**Finally, over on the far right, a set of cost-related columns helps validate the System Price and flag any issues before the offer moves into production:**

- **Painting Costs** â€“ Shows the cost of the selected paint job
- **Estimated Configuration Cost** â€“ Displays the total net cost of all recognised components, using live pricing from the **Inventory & Parts Management** sheet
- **Unknown Items** â€“ Flags any components not recognised by the system. Like the Configuration column, these appear in a dropdown for quick review, helping the team catch errors and ensure the build is complete and accurate

**Weâ€™ll take a closer look at how these fields support the pricing workflow in the next video.**
