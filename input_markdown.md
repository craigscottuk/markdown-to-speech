Jumping back to the **PAINTING & PARTS** sheet, we can now see that **Donaldson** has **26 out of 26 parts available**, and the percentage column is once again green — showing 100% readiness. We’ll need to refresh the spreadsheet to pull in the latest values into the dropdowns in the **Missing** column.

Let’s do that now — and as expected, there are no missing items listed for **Donaldson**.

Looking at some of the other projects in this sheet, we can see that a few have partially recovered:

- **Kučera** shows **14 out of 26** parts available, with a readiness of **54%**
- **Grabowski** has **12 out of 29**, showing **41%** readiness

And if we scroll up:

- **Koch** is at **17 out of 27**, or **68%**
- And **Kovalenko** is as high as **24 out of 29**, showing **83% readiness**, with just 5 parts still missing

This is happening because some of the parts we just added to the inventory are compatible with multiple builds. And since they haven’t yet been allocated to a specific project, they remain available for others.

This clearly demonstrates how **Available Stock** represents what’s physically on hand — and how that availability can be shared across multiple projects, depending on demand.
