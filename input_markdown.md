So just to summarise, the **System Price** includes:

- the target net margin
- labour for customer communication, preparation, and assembly
- the design and painting cost
- the estimated configuration cost
- and finally, VAT

If the customer’s preferred currency is **PLN**, the gross value appears in złoty. If **EUR** is selected, the final price is converted to Euros — and the **Offer Price** is recalculated with a newly rounded value to create clean, retail-friendly figures.

For example:  
**EUR** prices are rounded up to end in **...9 €**, while **PLN** prices are rounded up to end in **49 zł** or **99 zł** — all applied automatically.

The **Offer Price** is the final amount shown in the PDF offer document, but it can still be manually overridden by the sales team if a custom figure needs to be applied.

In the next video, we’ll look at how to generate a PDF offer document.
