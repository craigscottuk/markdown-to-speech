> **Some of the dropdowns include built-in logic and are interdependent. For example, the tyre selector works across three levels — manufacturer, model, and then size and colour — dynamically filtering the available options. There’s also a two-level dependency for wheelsets: selecting a 650B wheel size automatically filters both compatible tyres and wheelsets, preventing mismatches like pairing a 700C tyre with a 650B rim. All of this happens in real time using JavaScript.**
