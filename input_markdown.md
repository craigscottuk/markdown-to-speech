You’ll also notice that both the **System Price** and **Offer Price** cells are highlighted in red — because the system can’t calculate an accurate price without knowing the cost of every component.

To resolve this, we can either fix the typo — or, if it’s a valid part, add it to the **PARTS INDEX**.

In this case, it’s a valid part the customer would like us to use, so we’ll add it to the system.  
To do this, we’ll open the **Parts & Inventory Management** spreadsheet, go to the **PARTS INDEX** sheet, insert a new row, and enter the part’s details.

Once that’s done, we return to the **Offer & Production Management** spreadsheet and refresh it.  
This updates the system — the part is recognised, and the error disappears.

The better a project is managed at this early stage, the more profitable it’s likely to be — and the less chance there is of problems later in production.
