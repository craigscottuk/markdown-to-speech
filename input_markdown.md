This means all the components for **Donaldson** have been booked — and are no longer available to other projects. Lastly, let’s take a look at the **Total Stock** column, which remains unchanged, since the items are still physically on-site and tracked within the system.

This clearly shows how the system distinguishes between:

- what’s physically on the premises (**Total Stock**),
- what’s still available for other builds (**Available Stock**),
- and what’s already been booked for assembly (**Allocated to Assembly**).
