Next, we manually enter:

- The **Quantity** — the number of units received
- **And the Net Price**, in PLN — the unit price shown on the invoice

These values are then used to calculate the **Net Value** in the final column.

The data in this sheet is counted and dynamically fed into the **STOCK LEVELS** sheet, where it contributes to the **Total Stock** and **Available** stock calculations.

If we search for this item in the **STOCK LEVELS** sheet, we can see that it now has 100 units in **Total Stock** and **Available Stock**.
