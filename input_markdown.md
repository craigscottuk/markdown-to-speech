This sheet is where we make manual adjustments to stock levels — for example, if something’s been lost, damaged, or counted incorrectly.

Each row represents a single correction. Just like in the other stock sheets, we start by entering or selecting the **Item ID** from the dropdown in column C.

In the **QTY (+/–)** column, we enter the amount being added or removed from the system.  
To reduce stock, we use a minus value. To add something back — say it was returned or found in storage — we enter a positive value.

Following our example, let’s remove that last remaining unit of the PRO adjustable stem — let’s say it’s been damaged and can’t be sold or used in production.

To do this, I’m pasting in the **Item Code** for the item and entering **–1** in the quantity column to correct the count.

Now, if we search for this item in **STOCK LEVELS**, we can see that the final unit has been deducted — leaving 0 in both **Total Stock** and **Available Stock**.

Now let’s take a look at the final two sheets.
