Now that the payment has been logged, a yellow checkbox appears next to the amount. Ticking this checkbox flags the project for transfer to production.

We can mark multiple projects as **PAID** — entering each payment, confirming the details, and ticking the checkbox — to batch-transfer several projects at once. This allows the sales team to log payments as they come in, and move projects into production in bulk when ready.

For now, we’ll just send **Donaldson**, so we’ll untick the other project for **Scott** and move only one offer forward.

With our paid project selected, we open the **Send** menu and choose **Send to next stage**. A confirmation window appears, listing the selected projects. In this case, only **Donaldson** is selected, so the process will apply to that project alone.
