Now let’s return to the production sheet and complete the transfer.

Once we click **Yes**, the script runs — moving the project to the **Completed** sheet and automatically removing all its allocated components from inventory.

Let’s jump to the **STOCK LEVELS** sheet to watch this happen.

Everything has now been cleared — the net stock value is 0. If we remove the filter, every item shows 0 for both available and allocated quantities.

So, as well as moving **Donaldson** into the **Completed** sheet, the system has automatically cleared all its parts from inventory — no manual cleanup required.

Let’s head back to the main spreadsheet and click **OK** to dismiss the prompt.
That’s it — the transfer is complete, and **Donaldson** is now officially out of production.

If we switch over to the **COMPLETED** sheet and scroll to the bottom, we can see it listed here — ready for review in the final part of the series.
