Before we explore pricing, let’s take a closer look at the **OFFERS** sheet inside the **Offer & Production Management** spreadsheet.

This is the central workspace where the sales team add and manage offers in the system.

Each row represents an individual offer, containing key details such as status, pricing, customer information, and project configuration. All offers in this sheet are created using the offer creation forms.

The **Status** column contains dropdowns that let the sales team update each offer’s stage in the sales process. If an offer doesn’t go ahead — for example, if the customer declines the quote or chooses not to proceed — selecting **REMOVE** sends the row to the **OFFERS ARCHIVE**, where the data helps track interest and conversion over time.

Next to **Status**, we have fields for **Currency** and **VAT Rate**, followed by two key pricing columns: **System Price** and **Offer Price**.

The **System Price** is dynamic and calculated automatically based on the project's design and configuration, as well as the customer’s currency and VAT rate.

The **Offer Price** is initially derived from the **System Price**, then rounded up to produce clean, retail-friendly numbers. This is the final bike price presented to the customer in the offer document — but it can be overridden manually if needed, since the values in this column are static.

Each offer also includes two important dates: **Offer Date** and **Deadline**. These are grouped in a collapsible section that helps keep the sheet tidy.
