Next, we come to the **Focused** column — but before diving into that, let’s look at the **Status** column within the **Parts Preparation** section.

This dropdown tracks the progress of part preparation — specifically, whether the necessary components have been fetched and organised into a complete box ready for handoff to the mechanics, along with the painted frameset. By default, the status is set to **PARTS NOT PREPARED**, but it can be updated by the production team to:

- **PREPARING PARTS** – meaning the parts box is currently being assembled
- **PARTS READY** – meaning the box is complete and ready to be moved to the assembly stage

At the far right, the final column is used to send selected projects into the next stage. Tickboxes allow multiple projects to be batched. Once selected, the user can either click the **Send** label at the top of the column or use the **Send** option from the main menu, then choose **Send to next stage**.

A confirmation message appears, listing the selected projects. Clicking **Yes** will move them forward — but for now, we’ll click **No** and return to the **Focused** column, because it plays a key role in preparing each project for the Assembly stage.

The **Focused** column contains checkboxes that let us isolate a specific project — or several — for analysis in the **FOCUS** sheet. With **Donaldson** selected, let’s head there now.
