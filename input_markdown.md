Now let’s take a look at the **PAINTING & PARTS** sheet. This sheet is divided into two sections: the first, under the blue headers, focuses on tracking painting progress for the frame and fork; the second, under the red headers, supports the collection of all necessary parts for assembly. Together, they help the team monitor progress and determine which projects are ready to move into the next stage.

Each row represents an active project at this stage. If we scroll down, we can see the project for **Donaldson** listed at the bottom.

Looking at the **Painting Status** column, we can see that the painting of Donaldson’s frameset is currently set to **NOT STARTED**. This column tracks the current painting progress for each project, and the values are automatically synced with the **PRODUCTION** sheet — giving the team a high-level snapshot of how each build is progressing.

Now, let’s go back and walk through the rest of the **PAINTING & PARTS** sheet.

On the left-hand side, we start with the **Date Started**, which marks when the project officially entered production. Next is the **Days Left** column, showing how much time remains until the deadline. Beside that is a calculated **Priority** score — based on the project’s deadline, total cost, and part availability.

We can open the project in the **Project Manager** tool by clicking the checkbox here.

In the **Surname or Project Name** column, there’s a link that provides quick access to the latest version of the offer or project document..

The **Owner** column shows who is responsible for managing each project. Next, we see the **Frame** model and size — a key detail for the production team, as they'll need to select and tag a frameset of this exact model and size for preparation and painting.

Moving further right, we come to the **Paint Tracking** section, marked by the blue headers. The **Design** column shows the selected paint colour or scheme, followed by three tracking columns: **Frame Prep**, **Frame Painted**, and **Fork Painted**. Each includes a dropdown, allowing the team to update the project’s progress as it moves through each step. For example, we’d set **Frame Prep** to **Yes** once the frame has been prepared.

At the end of this section is the **Status (Painting)** column, which is updated by the production team and shows the overall painting progress. It’s currently set to **NOT STARTED**, which is the default when a project is first added to this stage.

Let’s say **Donaldson** has just been painted — updating the status to **PAINTED** will also set the previous tracking columns to **Yes**. From there, the project moves through quality control: the status changes to **PAINT QC** once it’s passed inspection, then to **PAINT PHOTO** after the owner has sent a photo of the painted frame to the customer.

Finally, once the customer confirms they’re happy with the design and paintwork, the status is updated to **PAINT APPROVED**, marking this part of production as complete.

To the right, we move into the **PARTS PREPARATION** section under the red headers. This part of the sheet focuses on gathering all the components needed to build the bike.

First, we have the **Config** column, which includes a dropdown showing the bike’s full setup at a glance. At this stage, the goal is to gather all the components listed here into one complete box — so they can be handed over, along with the painted frameset, to the mechanics for assembly.

To support this process, the next group of columns reflects the stock health for each project. These values are calculated using formulas that reference both the project’s configuration and live data from the **Parts & Inventory Management** spreadsheet.

Let’s take a closer look.
