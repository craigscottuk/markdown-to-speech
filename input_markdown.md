Closing the **Project Manager** and returning to the **PAINTING & PARTS** sheet, we can now see that **Donaldson** has **26 out of 26 parts available**. Both the **Availability** and **Percentage** columns are highlighted in green — indicating the project is ready to move forward.

However, the **Missing** column still shows an outdated value of **3** parts missing and displays a validation warning — marked by the small red triangle in the top-right corner of the cell.

Clicking into the dropdown reveals that it's now empty, as expected. A quick refresh of the spreadsheet will clear this up, and the **Missing** column will update to reflect the correct status.

This live link between the inventory system and production sheets helps the team stay up to date on part availability and project readiness in real time.

In **Part 11**, we’ll look at how the system handles **Available Stock** and **Allocated Stock** — and how that process is triggered automatically when a project moves from this stage into the next one: **ASSEMBLY & TESTING**.
