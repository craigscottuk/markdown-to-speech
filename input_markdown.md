The **Project Manager** offers a faster, more focused way to work — allowing users to concentrate on one project at a time.

Error checking is also built into the Project Manager. If we enter a typo in the configuration, conditional formatting highlights the issue immediately.

Switching back to the main spreadsheet, we’ll also see the part flagged there — and the pricing fields highlighted again.

So, edits made in the Project Manager are always synced to the **Offer & Production Management** spreadsheet — keeping everything up to date and consistent.
