To open an offer, simply tick the checkbox next to the project ID and name. This triggers a script that opens the **Project Manager Tool** in a new tab and pulls in the corresponding offer data from the main spreadsheet.

The **Project Manager** is a template spreadsheet that displays the same offer, but in a vertical layout, with information grouped into tabbed sections: **Status**, **Price**, **Dates**, **Configuration**, **Design**, and **Customer**.
