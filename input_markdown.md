Each column in this section represents a **specific component category** used in a bike build â€” like **Bottom Bracket**, **Crankset**, **Front Chainring**, or **Brake / Shift Lever**.

To help users make updates quickly and accurately, each cell includes a dropdown menu with a list of components in that category. This prevents typos or inconsistent naming, and helps users select parts without needing to memorise model numbers.
